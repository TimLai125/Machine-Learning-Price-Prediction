# What I Learned

* Advance JavaScript features such as function constructors, prototypal inheritance, first-class functions, closures, the bind and apply methods, and more. 
* Learn how to make JavaScript code interact with webpages: DOM manipulation.
* Implementing MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture: `BUDGET CONTROLLER`, `APP CONTROLLER` & `UI CONTROLLER`.
